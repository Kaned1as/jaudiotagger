Jaudiotagger
============

**Note: This project is a hard-fork of [ijabs one](https://bitbucket.org/ijabz/jaudiotagger), adding better support for mp4-dash and opus formats.
I use it for my projects but there's no guarantee it is suitable for you. Patches are welcome.**

*Jaudiotagger* is a Java API for audio metatagging. Both a common API and format
specific APIs are available, currently supports reading and writing metadata for:

- Mp3
- Flac
- OggVorbis
- Mp4
- Mp4 - DASH
- Aiff
- Wav
- Wma
- Dsf
- Opus
